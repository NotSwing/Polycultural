    <h1>Growing with Canada</h1>
    <p>Polycultural Immigrant and Community Services was incorporated on February 3, 1993 as a result of a 
        merger between two agencies: Polish Immigrant Aid Services (founded in 1973) and Polish Canadian 
        Community Services (founded in 1982). Amalgamation was completed in January 1994 with the purpose 
        of providing a broader range of services while avoiding duplication. On August 27, 2000 the 
        organization name was changed to Polycultural Immigrant and Community Services to better reflect 
        local communities served by the organization.</p>
